# Stocks-Analysis
Using tiingo api, looked into the Stock prices of four major stocks  'FNILX', 'NASDX', 'QQQ', 'VOO' during Lockdown
The index funds depicted are Fidelity ZERO Large Cap Index (FNILX), Shelton NASDAQ-100 Index Direct(NASDC), Invesco QQQ Trust ETF(QQQ) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO). It depicts the volatility and skew of the price changes in closing prices. The x axis represents percentage change and the y axis represents the frequency. Looking at the data, the most volatile index fund is NASDX and the least volatile is VOO. QQQ was the most skewed towards having a positive percentage change in closing prices. From this it could be implied that QQQ saw greater growth in closing prices over the cause of the year. I would suggest that for low-risk investors that they should invest in VOO and high-risk investors could take a chance at NASDX which tracks the primarily tech companies in the Nasdaq-100 index. NASDX could have been more volatile due to the tech company boom during 2020-2021 during the pandemic. I state this as during the pandemic many investors ran to invest in stay at home tech stocks like netflix and zoom. To make this data analysis better the median should be calculated. All are negatively skew. I utilised different number of bins to get different insights which confirm my analysis.
